We are all born,
and eventually we all die -
我們出生，然後我們死亡
3
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,960
- that is how it
has all been planned.
這全部都是計畫好的。

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,600
You don't know when it will happen...
And thinking about it is of no use.
你不知道什麼時候會發生.....想這件事情也是沒意義。

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,880
To paraphrase Socrates:
套用蘇格拉底所說的話；

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,240
"If death is but a long sleep,
it must be a wonderful thing."
如果死亡只不過是一個漫長的睡眠，
它一定是一個美妙的事情。

One should never fear the unknown.

He was always
looking for fun and games.
他總是在開玩笑和遊戲。

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,920
And that was great,
because no one likes a curmudgeon.
那真的很棒，因為沒有人喜歡一個倔老頭。

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,240
Love is having someone
you enjoy being with...
愛就是擁有一個你喜歡和他相處在一起的人...

12
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,880

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,880
And then there is the sexual aspect.
That's usually how it all begins...
當然這其中還有著性。
通常這就是一切的開始....

18
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,840
When we got married
we didn't want children -
我們剛結婚時，我們並不想要小孩。

19
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,480
- because my husband was Jewish
and Hitler had occupied Denmark.
因為我的丈夫是猶太人，希特勒佔領了丹麥。

20
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,960
When I woke up on 9th April, 1940,
there was a terrible racket.
當我在1940年4月9日起床時，一個很可怕的聲響。

the blinds to have a look -
我跑去窗戶旁打開百葉窗....

dropping something from the air.
從滿是飛機的天空中掉了東西下來。

23
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,000
It was unreal.
It was like a bolt from the blue.
一點都不真實，好似晴天霹靂。

24
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,400
It was like a
sudden slap to the face.
就好似被打了一巴掌。

25
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,800
It was...
We didn't know what was happening.

26
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,080
They would transport Jews on trucks
and load them onto ships.

the concentration camps were.
我們不知道集中營到底是怎樣。

有傳言，一個猶太人娶了一個非猶太人

that's what the Germans said -
你們兩個可能會沒事。至少德國人是這樣說

30
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,640

received word from a "good" German -

going to be rounded up.

33
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,480
I was guilty of miscegenation
because I had married a Jew.
我因為和一個猶太人結婚。

34
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,440

describe those who were not Aryans-
他們有一個專業名詞來描寫那些非亞利安人

If we had a child together...

determined it... But we thought...
據說，這是母親的決定....但我們認為....

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,520
We didn't trust the Germans, and the
child of course would be half-Jewish.
我們不相信德國人，而且我們的小孩是半個猶太人。

40

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,680
The night in question
turned into a nightmare.
出事情的那晚成了噩夢。

48
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,240
Suddenly, the engine cut out
and the boat started bobbing about.
突然，引擎不動了，船開始漂。
50

"發生了什麼事?"我們喊著。

a German patrol boat -

為了不被他們的雷達發現，他們必須要把引擎關掉。

we heard this sound...
15分鐘過後，我們聽到聲音...

we could breathe a sigh of relief.
我們知道，我們可以鬆一口氣。

We became more optimistic as
things started going against Hitler.
我們變得更加樂觀，因為局勢開始對希特勒不利。

55
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,040
That kept us going. We knew
it was only a question of time.
這件事情驅使著我們繼續下去。我們知道只是時間上的問題。

And Micky, remember to smile.
時間設定倒數九秒，還有Micky 記得要微笑。

I always look
foolish in photographs...
我相片中總是看起來笨笨的...

62
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,920

keep talking. Let's take one more.
那是因為你總是在說話。我們在拍一張。

important to have a hobby -

66
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,600

people younger than yourself.

was 94 when she died.
我婆婆在94歲時過世。

left to talk to from those days".
沒有人可以和我一起聊著那些過去的日子。"

all the good memories with.

which you cannot change -
變老是生命中一個你無法改變的事實，
