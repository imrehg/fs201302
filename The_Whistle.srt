00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,020
Handball.
手碰球。

142

Hey, what's going on!
嘿，怎麼了!

144

Continue!
繼續!

145
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,180
Why are you surprised at the highest league,

when they are fixing the match here, fuck!
當他們在這踢球時，操!

147
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,040
Idiots!
笨蛋!

148
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,020
Are you fucking mad?
你瘋了嗎?

Player number 17!
17號球員!

150
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,150
What?
什麼?

151
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,040
What? I should show you a yellow card!
什麼?我應該給你黃牌!

152

Bravo, well-done!
太好了，幹的好!

153
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,070
What the fuck is the referee doing?
裁判到底在做啥?

154
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,110
Fucked!
操!

155
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,090
He should have shown a red card, fuck!
他應該亮紅牌的，操!

156
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:55,130
It seems to me that I did it right.
There was a hand.
看起來我是對的，真的有碰球。

157
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,030
Fuck ...
操...

158
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,030
And the situation with the hand,
關於那個手碰球的事件，
159
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,020
maybe I shouldn't have shown him
a yellow card,
也許我不應該亮他黃牌，

160
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,020
but he was lying on the grass
and the ball was rolling towards him
但球正往他那邊過去時他正躺在地上，

161
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,200
and I think, he stopped it with his hand
when he was getting up.
所以我判斷在他起身的時候用手將球停住。

162
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,120
So you think it was wrong.
If there was no hand ...
也許你錯了。
假如根本就沒碰到手....

163
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,080
But it was!
就是有啊!

164
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,240
This is a kind of "Ruber",
這是種"Ruber"，

165
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,060
and this is "Aurera" ..., also "Pecherznica", 
還有這是"Aurera"....,，還有"Pecherznica"

166
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,060
but you trim it.
這要修剪。

167
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,090
Nice, isn't it?
It is very good just for urban conditions.
很棒，不是嗎?
就種在城市的狀況而言算是很不錯的。

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,090
And you know, with such claims that 
I would have fixed the score,
你知道，有傳言我有對比數動手腳。，

169
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:56,100
and you know, they treat me like a person 
who came, took the money and went away,
你並不知道，他們將我視為來拿了錢就走，

170
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,210
as if I would have everything in my ass.
一點都不把我當專業。

171
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,070
They think that a referee has no feelings at all,
他們覺得裁判一點感覺都沒有，

172
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,020
and that he doesn't care about what he's doing,
一點都不在乎他在做什麼，

173
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,010
a referee is a fucking machine or a robot, 
that he comes, gives yellow cards, 
一個裁判就像是一台可惡的機械，或一個機器人，
他過來，亮黃牌，

174
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:20,020
and that the most important thing for them is taking
the money and then leaving, fuck!
對他們來說最重要的就是過來拿了錢就走，操!

175
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,190
And where is his psyche?
Where is everything?
他的心在哪裡?
全部的東西都在哪裡?


176
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:42,120
And listen ..., on the eleventh, you know, 
there is the independence day, yeah?
在11號，就是獨立紀念日，

177
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,030
Independence day, it's your name's day.

Victoria 會過來。

179
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,120
That's right, Victoria means victory,

180
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,220
finally she will defeat you.
他最後會擊敗你。

181
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,020

- 是啊，但她是正妹?
- 漂亮啊.....像你一樣。

182
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,240
What are you talking about?

犯規!

185
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,230
Player number 14!

186
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,020
I have seen it!
我看到了!

187
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,160
And for you the same yellow card, 
because you don't have to swear.
同一張黃牌，因為你沒必要說髒話。

188
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,040
I know that it is a scandal.
How you behave is a scandal.
我聽過這個傳聞，聽過你行為上的傳聞。

189
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,090
I'm only telling you that you can't stay
in the lowest football league,
我只是告訴你，你不能一直停留在最低等的足球聯盟，

you must constantly improve your skills.
你必須要不斷的提升你的技術。

191

And that's all, so far.

192
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,150
Summing up, I'm estimating you well.
總歸一句，我覺得你很不錯。

193
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,130
<i>"How long in Wawel's castle 
Zygmunt's bell sounds,

194
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:13,010
<i>so long Marcin's Vistula river 
will send a water to the see.

195
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:19,110
<i>Our land will be standing,
stand up a royal town,

196
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,190
<i>Wisła Kraków will win
because it's Marcin's club".

So Macius, are we resting?
