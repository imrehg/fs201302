00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:59,324
I wanted to
breathe in the mold,
我希望在瀰漫著黴的空氣裡呼吸著

138
00:10:00,273 --> 00:10:01,678
just to know it.
了解它

139
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,486
To have it grow inside of me ...
讓他在我體內生長

140
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:07,165
Over my eyes,
佈滿我的雙眼

141
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:08,975
and my teeth,
和牙齒

142
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,576
so that I would be in the ground
這樣一來我就會被埋進地底

143
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,134
and become it ...
而成為它

144
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,632
become a kind of mold myself
使自己成為一種黴

145
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:18,805
and then float through the air
飄散在空氣中

146
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,019
and grow inside of you.
並在你身體裡茁壯

147
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:26,271
Inside the wet,
warm insides of your body,
濕潤又溫暖的體內

148
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:29,460
until we were all the same thing.
直到我們都成為黴病為止
