1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,437
她沒有被踢爆屁股，我只能告訴你那麼多
She got nothing short of an ass-blasting, I can tell you that much.

2
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:23,477
那賤人有戀足癖還是什麼的，我甚至完全不知道
Bitch had a foot fetish or something, I don't even know.

3
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:46,211
我是安德魯奈曼
I'm Andrew Neyman.

4
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:49,354
先調到B調，等一下你要跟我一起排練
Tune the set to B-flat and then you'll turn my pages during rehearsal.

5
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:01,864
不好意思?
Excuse me?

6
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:04,422
不好意思?
Excuse me?

7
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,175
可以幫忙我調一下B調嗎?
Could I have a B-flat please?

8
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:21,912
或許能幫忙我調一下..?
Could I maybe have --?

9
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,859
幹他媽的快調音!
Milk the cunt!

10
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:26,332
按順序吹
Down the line.

11
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:48,514
我們今天有菜鳥，各位
We have a squeaker today, people. 

12
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:51,938
奈曼，19歲，他是不是很可愛?
Neiman. Nineteen years old.Isn't he cute?

13
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,174
奈曼...
Nei-man ...

14
00:03:55,414 --> 00:03:57,176
好啦，小夥子們
Alright, gang. 

15
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:58,829
"揮鞭猛擊"
'' Whiplash ''

16
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:49,729
翻頁
Page.

17
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,311
翻頁了!
Page!

18
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:01,300
停，巴爾克..
Stop. Barker --

19
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:04,125
那不是你男朋友的小弟弟，不要急著來
that is not your boyfriend's dick.Do not come early.

20
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:06,599
繼續演奏
Skipping ahead.

21
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,959
93小節
Bar 93.

22
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:12,825
5、6、接著來..
Five-six-and

23
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,966
停!
Stop! 

24
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:56,188
現在真的讓我不開心了，我們有個吹得亂七八糟的團員
Now this one really upsets me.We have an out-of-tune player.

25
00:05:57,146 --> 00:06:00,148
在我說出來前，那個團員認得出是自己嗎?
Before I go any further would that player care to identify himself?

26
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,819
也許是有蟲飛進我的耳朵
Maybe a bug flew in my ear.

27
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:06,227
第115小節，5、6、接著來..
Bar 115. Five-six-and --

28
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,410
不
No.

29
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:13,555
不，我的耳朵好得很，我們大概證明了有人在亂吹
No, my ears are fine,we most definitely have an out-of-tune player.

30
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:16,615
不管是誰，這是你最後的機會
Whoever it is this is your last chance.

31
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:22,253
無論你是知道你吹錯
Either you know you are playing out of tune

32
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:25,203
並且因此壞了我的樂團
and are therefore deliberately sabotaging my band,

33
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,530
還是你不知道吹得不對
or you do not know you're playing out of tune,

34
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,754
不管怎樣，我怕你會再更糟
which I'm afraid is even worse.

35
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,630
看譜，5、6、接著來..
Reeds.Five-six-and --

36
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:40,117
長號，5、6、接著來..
Bones.Five-six-and --

37
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,691
噢，找到了
Ah, he's here.

38
00:06:57,103 --> 00:06:59,103
告訴我不是你吧，艾默佛德
Tell me it's not you Elmer Fudd.

39
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:10,141
沒關係，繼續
It's ok. Play.

40
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,286
停
Stop. 

41
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
你知道你吹錯了嗎?
Do you think you're out of tune?

42
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:30,163
你是怎樣..並沒有天殺的火星文小節在那吧
What are you --there's no fucking Mars bar down there.

43
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:33,132
我就在這裡，看著我
I'm up here, look at me.

44
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:39,493
你知道你在亂吹嗎?
Do you think you're out of tune?

45
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:43,924
知道
Yes.

46
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,337
那你為什麼幹他媽的不應話?!?
Then why the fuck didn't you say so ?!?

47
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,837
我的天啊!!
Jesus !!

48
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,015
我已經讓你的肥屁股在這裡太久了，梅茲
I have been carrying your fat ass for too long, Metz.

49
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,426
我不會讓你浪費樂團的競爭力
I will not let you cost this band a competition

50
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:58,471
因為你離不開幹他媽的快樂兒童餐而且沒辦法吹在音準上
because you can't keep your mind off a fucking Happy Meal and on pitch.

51
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,263
史丹..恭喜了
Stein -- congratulations,

52
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:02,703
你不再是儲備樂手，現在你是第四長號手
you are no longer alternate,you are now fourth chair trombone.

53
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
梅茲..給我該死的滾出去
Metz -- get the fuck out.

54
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:23,098
回到剛剛的弦律，梅茲沒有吹錯
For the record, Metz was not out of tune.

55
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:25,598
你才吹錯了，瓦拉赫
You were, Wallach.

56
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:27,784
但他分不出來
But he didn't know. 

57
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:29,782
那就夠糟糕了
And that's bad enough.

58
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:35,206
好吧，休息十分鐘，等會兒回來，新人就得加入了
Alright, take ten.When we get back, the squeaker is on.

59
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:52,348
你知道如果佛德付出一半的努力來練習長號
You know if Fudd put half the effort into playing the trombone

60
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:55,828
像他喜歡閃閃發光的起司漢堡一樣，我們才不會....
as he does into polishing off cheeseburgers, we wouldn't be....

61
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:02,669
聽著，安德魯
Listen, Andrew.

62
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,866
我知道你在那裏頭看見的事正讓你煩惱
I know what you saw in there is worrying you.

63
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,851
但有個很大的不同
But there's a big difference.

64
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,692
這是你的第一天
This is your first day.

65
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,903
梅茲已經擺爛兩年了
Metz had been dragging mud for two years.

66
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:13,696
而且，你不是艾默佛德
Besides,you're no Elmer Fudd.

67
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:18,260
這對你來說是個很大的機會..你知道的，對吧?
This is a huge opportunity for you-- you know that, right?

68
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:19,744
我知道...
Yeah ...

69
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:21,744
你的父母是音樂家嗎?
Your parents musicians?

70
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:24,457
不...不算是...
No -- not really ...

71
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:26,259
他們在做什麼的?
What do they do?

72
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,110
嗯，我爸是個作家..
Well my dad is a writer --

73
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:30,126
喔，他寫過哪些作品?
Oh. What's he written?

74
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,506
嗯..我想他主要從事..
Well -- I guess he's mainly a

75
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:34,522
他是個老師，主要是老師，我猜啦
he's a teacher, mainly, I guess.

76
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,319
哪一間學校?
College?

77
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:36,895
賓尼頓高中
Pennington High.

78
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:38,972
那你媽呢,她在做甚麼的?
What about your mom, what does she do?

79
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:41,078
我不知道
I don't know.

80
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,183
我還是嬰兒時她就離開我了
She left when I was a baby.

81
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:48,409
所以你家族裡沒有玩音樂的?
So no players in the family?

82
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:49,979
不，我想沒有...
No, I guess not ...

83
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:51,995
嗯，你只能向偉大的音樂家學習了
Well, you just have to listen to the greats then.

84
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:54,555
巴迪瑞奇，喬瓊斯
Buddy Rich, Jo Jones.

85
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:56,646
你知道，查理派克就是叫做"鳥"的那個樂手
You know, Charlie Parker became Bird

86
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,705
因為瓊斯朝他的頭丟了個鈸
because Jones threw a cymbal at his head.

87
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,297
那夜他哭著睡著，但從此也轉變為所皆知的人物
He cried himself to sleep that night but it made him Bird.

88
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:04,297
你懂我的意思嗎?
You see what I'm saying?

89
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,085
重點是..放輕鬆
The key is -- just relax.

90
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:09,112
好嗎?
Ok?

91
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:11,589
別擔心韻律還是其他樂手怎麼看
Don't worry about the numbers or what the other players think.

92
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:15,648
你能在這裡是有原因的
You're here for a reason.

93
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:17,921
你相信我說的，對吧?
You believe that, right?

94
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,628
是的
Yeah.

95
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:21,824
照著說一遍
Say it.

96
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:24,415
我能在這裡是有原因的
I'm here for a reason.

97
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:25,959
是啊
Yeah. 

98
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,853
可以嗎?
Ok?

99
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,561
好啦，現在玩開心點
Alright. Now have fun.

100
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,834
好了，小夥子們，"揮鞭猛擊"
Alright, gang.'' Whiplash ''. 

101
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:10,038
奈曼..盡力做到最好，好嗎?
Neiman -- just do your best. Ok?

102
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,383
5、6、7..
Five-six-seven

103
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,356
我們來聽些好聽的
Let's hear some fills.

104
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
我們有個巴迪瑞奇在這裡!
We've got Buddy Rich here!

105
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:04,413
好吧..有個小問題，不要緊
Ok --- little trouble there, no problem.

106
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:06,913
回到第17小節
Let's pick it up at 17.

107
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,441
接著..5、6、7..
And ... five-six-seven

108
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:15,870
節奏不對，好嗎?
Not my tempo. Ok?

109
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,839
5、6、7..
Five-six-seven 

110
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:23,067
強拍落在第18小節，可以嗎?
Downbeat on 18. Ok?

111
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,570
5、6、7..
Five-six-seven

112
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,816
4個拍子..第17小節，4個節拍，好嗎?
The and of 4 --- bar 17,the and of 4. Ok?

113
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,558
接著..5、6、7..
And ... five-six-seven

114
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,919
第17小節，4個拍子,可以嗎?
17, the and of 4. Ok?

115
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,919
你有點搶拍了
And you're rushing a little.

116
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:43,071
好了嗎? 5、6、7..
Alright? Five-six-seven

117
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:47,465
這和我的節奏不一樣
Not quite my tempo.

118
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,142
太好了，我們繼續
All good, here we go.

119
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:50,942
不...預備起?
No --- ready?

120
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,748
5、6、7...
Five-six-seven

121
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,186
抱歉，你現在拖拍了
Sorry, you're dragging a little now.

122
00:12:58,686 --> 00:13:00,122
繼續
Here we go.

123
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:05,397
都好了? 5、6、7..
All set? Five-six-seven

124
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,983
你又搶拍
You're rushing.

125
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:13,953
5、6、7..
Five-six-seven

126
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:18,385
現在又拖拍
Dragging.

127
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:19,788
5、6、7..
Five-six-seven

128
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:49,849
為什麼你讓我想向你丟張椅子，奈曼?
Why do you suppose I just hurled a chair at your head, Neiman?

129
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:52,223
我不知道
你知道
I don't know.
Yes you do.

130
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:54,982
你幹什麼不是搶拍就是拖拍?
Were you rushing, or were you dragging?

131
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,211
我不知道
I don't know.

132
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:59,257
算拍子
Start counting.

133
00:14:00,393 --> 00:14:01,473
5、6、7..
Five-six-seven

134
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,342
4個拍子，白癡!
In four, damnit!

135
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,666
1、2、3、4..眼睛看我
One-two-three-four--Look at me.

136
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,016
1、2、3、4..1、2、3、4..
One-two-three-four --One-two-three-four

137
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:07,254
1、2、3、4..
one-two-three-four

138
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:09,179
停，我有搶拍或拖拍嗎?
Stop. Was I rushing or was I dragging?

139
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,015
搶拍或拖拍?
Rushing or dragging?

140
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:12,856
我不知道
I don't know.

141
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,032
再算一次拍子
Start counting again.

142
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:16,551
1、2、3、4...1、2、3、4...1、2、3、4....
One-two-three-four---one-two-three-four---one-two-three-four

143
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:18,429
停，搶拍或拖拍?
搶拍了!
Stop. Rushing or dragging?
Rushing!

144
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,078
那你知道不一樣在哪裡了
So you do know the difference!

145
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:23,249
如果你故意要破壞我的樂團
If you deliberately sabotage my band

146
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:25,749
我會像幹譙豬一樣幹譙你
I will fuck you like a pig.

147
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,778
現在你是趕時間還是拖拖拉拉?
Now are you a rusher or are you a dragger

148
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,051
還是你要跟著我該死的節奏?!?
or are you going to be on my fucking time?!?

149
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,365
我會跟好你的節奏
I'm going to be on your time.

150
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:36,641
這是什麼?
What does this say?

151
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,641
104小節上的一個四分之一音符
打104小節的拍子給我聽
A quarter-note 104.
Give me a 104.

152
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,259
1、2、3、4....1、2、3、4...1、2、3、4....
One-two-three-four----one-two-three-four---one-two-three

153
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:47,916
我操他媽的老天爺，我不知道還可以慢一點再相信耶穌
Jesus fucking Christ, I did not know they allowed retards into Shaffer!

154
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:51,574
我可以相信你天殺的就是弄不懂節奏嗎?
Am I to believe that you cannot fucking read tempo?

155
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,728
你懂什麼音樂??這幹他媽的是什麼?
Can you even read music?? What the fuck is this?

156
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,190
這是二分之一音符
這是什麼?
It's a half-note.
What is this?

157

It's a dotted sixteenth.Sight-read this measure.

158
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,660
Bop-bop-ba-bop-ba-bop-ba-bop

159
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:02,179
你在做什麼，你是該死的人聲樂團嗎?
What are you, in a fucking a cappella group?

160
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:04,198
打好天殺的節奏
Play the goddamn set!

161
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:06,858
停
Stop.

162
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:09,583
現在回答我的問題
Now answer my question. 

163
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:12,325
你在搶拍還是拖拍?
Were you rushing or were you dragging?

164
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:15,566
回答我!!!

看著我
Look at me.

167
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:24,742
親愛的上帝，那是眼淚嗎?
Dear God, is that a tear?

168
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,451
你是那些愛哭鬼其中之一嗎?
Are you one of those single-tear people?

169
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,442
我在你眼裡看起來像個超賤的同性戀嗎?
Do I look like a double fucking rainbow to you?

170
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,081
你現在有多該死的沮喪啊?
How fucking upset are you right now?

171
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:32,317
我沒有沮喪
I'm not upset.

172
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:33,415
噢，所以你對這一切都不屑一顧囉?
Oh, so you don't give a shit about any of this?

173
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:34,022
我沒有不屑..
I do give a shit

174
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,606
所以你是非常沮喪還是不是....是還是該死的不是?
So you are upset or are you not ----yes or fucking no?

175
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,774
我....是的
I am ---- yes.

176
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:40,187
你很沮喪
是的...
You are upset.
Yes I am

177
00:15:40,282 --> 00:15:41,290
我是..
說啊..
I am
Say it

178
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,289
我很沮喪
說大聲點讓所有團員都能聽清楚
I am upset.
Say it so the whole band can hear you.

179
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:46,897
再說大聲點讓大家都幹他媽的聽清楚啊!
Say it so the whole fucking band can hear you!

180

你這個沒種、沒人要、沒價值、不敢承認是同性戀的該死的窩囊廢
You are a dickless, friendless, worthless,faggot-lipped fucking piece of shit,

184
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,943
難怪你媽要離開你老爸
whose Mommy ran out on Daddy 

185
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,055
因為她發現他才不是尤金歐尼爾
because she found out he wasn’t Eugene O'Neil,

186
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:04,898
而且現在是誰在擦眼淚還留了我整組鼓上都是口水
and who is now weeping and slobbering all over my drum kit.

187
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,251
所以為了最後的他媽的父親時間

再練得更努力點，奈曼
Start practicing harder, Neiman.

192
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,651

Alright gang --- '' Whiplash'' ,
